# Background 

The scared ecologist will often find themselves confronted with a large number of variables in their datasets. Thankfully, they are aware that fitting each variable as a predictor in their model(s) is likely not the optimal approach. Rather, they need to reduce the large number of variables down into a few variables that preserve as much of the original variance possible.
