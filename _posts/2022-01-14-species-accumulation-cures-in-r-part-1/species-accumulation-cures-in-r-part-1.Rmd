# Background 

Today, we are going to look at how to compute and plot species 
accumulation curves (hereafter 'SAC') using the amazing `vegan` package. SAC's are extremely popular in ecological analyses as they allow us to evaluate whether performing additional sampling is required to record all of the insect species associated with a particular plant species, for example.  

In this session, we are going to cover the most basic SAC - observed richness.
Observed species richness (hereafter '*S*') simply tells us:  
* how many species we have recorded, to date, and   
* whether more surveys could yield new additional species.   
* But, it **DOES NOT** tell us how many species could be in the community (i.e. we cannot extrapolate) - we will cover how to extrapolate species richness in a later post.  

### Data 

Let's load in a typical community richness dataset (species abundance matrix). This dataset represents the insect community associated with the shurb, *Lycium ferocissimum*, in South Africa. 

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Load required packages 
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, 
               tidyr, 
               janitor,
               vegan)

# Read in data 
sp_comm <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guysutton/CBC_coding_club/master/data_raw/species_abundance_matrix_ex.csv") %>%
  # Clean column names 
  janitor::clean_names()

# Check data entry 
dplyr::glimpse(sp_comm)

```


```{r, results = FALSE, include = FALSE}

# Set ggplot theme
theme_set(theme_classic() +
            theme(panel.border = element_rect(colour = "black", fill = NA),
                  axis.text = element_text(colour = "black"),
                  axis.title.x = element_text(margin = unit(c(2, 0, 0, 0), "mm")),
                  axis.title.y = element_text(margin = unit(c(0, 4, 0, 0), "mm")),
                  legend.position = "none"))
```

### Basic species accumulation curve

Now it is time to compute our species accumulation curve. To do this, we will use the `poolaccum` function from the `vegan` R package. Notice the first few columns are site description variables (i.e. not species abundances). We need to remove these columns, and only input the columns containing species abundances. 

```{r sac, echo = TRUE}
sac_raw <- sp_comm %>%
  # Remove site decsription variables 
  dplyr::select(-c(provinces, climatic_zones, site, season, haplotype)) %>%
  # Compute SAC
  vegan::poolaccum(.)
```

We now need to extract our observed species richness (*S*) estimates.  

* N - No. of surveys (i.e. survey effort)  
* S - Observed species richness  
* lower2.5 - lower 95% confidence interval of *S*  
* upper97.5 - upper 95% confidence interval of *S*  


```{r result, echo = TRUE}
# Extract observed richness (S) estimate 
obs <- data.frame(summary(sac_raw)$S, check.names = FALSE)
colnames(obs) <- c("N", "S", "lower2.5", "higher97.5", "std")
head(obs)
``` 

### Make a plot 

Finally, we can plot the desired species accumulation curve. Ultimately, we would like to see our *S* estimate and the 95% confidence intervals reach an asymptote (flat line) on the y-axis. This would indicate that performing additional surveys is highly unlikely to yield additional insects on the plant we have surveyed. 

```{r curve, echo = TRUE}
obs %>%
  ggplot(data = ., aes(x = N,
                       y = S)) +
  # Add confidence intervals
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lower2.5,
                  ymax = higher97.5),
              alpha = 0.5,
              colour = "gray70") +
  # Add observed richness line 
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "No. of surveys",
       y = "Observed richness",
       subtitle = "More surveys are required to find all the insects on this plant")

```
